'selected genes' are the 4.4k genes containing snps which are found in ~ half the cultivars.
	may be good to see where they fall out biologically if any end up implicated.

selected gene counts are the total number of snps in each gene across all cultivars 
included to show which genes have outlying numbers of snps e.g. SORBI_3001G353900.


gene_cultivar_call.dataframe.gz

Is a table of the 4.4k genes as observations and the number of snps* found in each of
the 362 cultivars as features.


To widen the focus from genes to cultivars the gene_cultivar_call.dataframe
was clustered using k-means with euclidean distances for 30 partitions (of genes)

'cultivar_k30cluster_score.dataframe' is the 362 cultivars as observations
and the number of snps that cultivar has in the 30 gene clusters as features.

`gene_clustK30.tab` is a mapping from genes to the catagorical "cluster id" 
used in 'cultivar_k30cluster_score.dataframe'. 


My intuition is being streatched a bit thin here on how we would get an explanation 
of why something worked if something works. 
But happy to try. 

Also willing to try other clustering approaches ...
